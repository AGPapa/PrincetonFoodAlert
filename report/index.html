<P> Elevator Pitch:
Everyone has favorite foods. Food can get people up in the morning, brighten up a long day, and remind people of home. 
But with Princeton serving hundreds of food items in over five different dining halls every day, wouldn’t it be great if
 students could know exactly where and when their favorite foods will be served on campus?
 Additionally, all upperclassmen get two free swipes per week to use in the dining halls,
 but with all the different eating options it can be difficult to decide when to use them.
 Wouldn’t it be great if upperclassmen students could maximize their two weekly meal swipes by knowing exactly
 where and when the best food of the week will be? Enter Princeton Food Alert, a web-based application that allows students
 to sign up for alerts when their favorite foods are on the menu and get notifications when the best foods are being served.
